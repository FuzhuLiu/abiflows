Overview

AbiFlows provides workflows to automate ab-initio calculations with Abinit.
The package is interfaced with `Pymatgen <http://www.pymatgen.org>`_  ...

AbiFlows supports both Python 2.7 as well as Python >= 3.4.
Note however that Python 2.7 is more intensively tested than py3k, especially at the level of workflows.
We hence still recommend py2.7 if you plan to run automatic calculations.

AbiFlows is free to use. However, we also welcome your help to improve this library by making your own contributions.
Please report any bugs and issues at AbiFlows `Github page <https://github.com/abinit/abiflows>`_.
